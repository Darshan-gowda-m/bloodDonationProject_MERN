# bloodDonationProject_MERN(WORKING IN PROGRESS)

A full-stack MERN project on Blood collection and usage tracking  acting as a interface between hospitals,donors and organizations

PROBLEM:
Introduction The scarcity of timely blood supply in India has severe consequences for public health, contributing to a high number of preventable deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that India needs at least 1% of its population to donate blood annually—approximately 13 million units—to meet demand. However, the country often faces a shortfall of up to 3 million units each year, impacting various vulnerable populations.

Key Impacts of Blood Shortages
Maternal Mortality
Critical Need: Severe bleeding, particularly postpartum hemorrhage, accounts for about 20% of maternal deaths in India. Access to timely blood is crucial during childbirth.
Statistics: WHO reports around 70,000 annual maternal deaths due to hemorrhage, many of which could be mitigated with adequate blood supply.
Trauma and Accident-Related Deaths

Road Safety Crisis: With over 150,000 road traffic deaths annually, many trauma victims require immediate blood transfusions.
Consequences: Delays in accessing blood significantly increase mortality rates among trauma patients.
Chronic Illnesses

Thalassemia and Hemophilia: Approximately 100,000 Indians with thalassemia depend on regular blood transfusions. Hemophilia patients also require a steady supply, and shortages can lead to life-threatening complications.
Cancer Treatment: Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy often need transfusions. A lack of blood exacerbates their vulnerable condition.
Anemia-Related Deaths
